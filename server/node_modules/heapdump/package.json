(That is, the function does not block.)\n\nOn Windows, however, it returns only after the snapshot is fully written.\nIf the heap is large, that may take a while.\n\nOn UNIX platforms, you can force a snapshot by sending the node.js process\na SIGUSR2 signal:\n\n    $ kill -USR2 <pid>\n\n### Inspecting the snapshot\n\nOpen [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) and\npress F12 to open the developer toolbar.\n\nGo to the `Profiles` tab, right-click in the tab pane and select\n`Load profile...`.\n\nSelect the dump file and click `Open`.  You can now inspect the heap snapshot\nat your leisure.\n",
